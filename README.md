## 1. Application name: 
Sallie Shoppie
https://sallie-shoppe.herokuapp.com/

## 2. Project Topic/Objective:  
This is an e-commerce website for online shopping. Customers need to sign-up by entering their information (name, shipping address, card payment, email, phone number). We offer variety of products such as clothes and home decorations. Users can pick the products they would like to buy, put them in the cart and then place an order. Salies Shopper will send notifications to users when the website have promotions. 

## 3. Motivation:  
I love shopping. Most of the time I only buy something when it is on sale in order to save money. Sometimes, I missed the sale-off or the items ran out too fast. This website will help me keep track of the sales and buy the items immediately. 

## 4. Server-Side Components:  
The application needs to store the user's name, phone number, address in order to ship the products and the debit/credit card information in order to place the orders. The application also needs the API of different shopping websites to display their products information (price, pictures, description) and update sale promotion.
